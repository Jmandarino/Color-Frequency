# COLOR FREQUENCY

## About

the purpose of this project was to emulate Apple's music app as well as spotify's music player's. These applications
presumably choose ui colors based on album art. To facilitate this idea I chose Kmean to pick the most frequent colors.

In the future this could be useful for media player app's I create in the future.

### Start guide & Dependencies

This program needs Python 3.x and will not work with 2.7 (only few modifications are needed to make 2.7 work).

Dependencies:

1. scipy (calculations/algo)
2. Image (to process images)
